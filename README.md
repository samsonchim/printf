## Description

This project provides a utility for handling conversion specifiers in C programming. It specifically focuses on the `d` and `i` specifiers, as well as introduces a custom specifier `b` for converting unsigned integers to binary.

## Conversion Specifiers

- `d`: This specifier is used for formatting signed decimal integers.
- `i`: Similar to `d`, `i` is used for formatting signed decimal integers.

Please note that flag characters, field width, precision, and length modifiers are not handled in this utility.

## Custom Conversion Specifiers

- `b`: The unsigned integer argument is converted to binary representation.

## Usage

To use this utility in your C code, include the corresponding header file and call the respective functions for conversion.

```c
#include "converter.h"

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    char binary[33]; // Assuming 32-bit integer
    
    int_to_binary(num, binary);
    
    printf("Decimal: %d\nBinary: %s\n", num, binary);
    
    return 0;
}



#include "converter.h"

int main() {
    unsigned int num = 10;
    char binary[33];
    
    int_to_binary(num, binary);
    
    printf("Decimal: %u\nBinary: %s\n", num, binary);
    
    return 0;
}


Decimal: 10
Binary: 00000000000000000000000000001010
